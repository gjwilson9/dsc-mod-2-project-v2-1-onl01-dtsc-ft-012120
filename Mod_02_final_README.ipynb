    "The dataset of home sale prices in the King County area provided enough variable information to perform linear regression models that yielded approximately 80% predictive accuracy. The model was constrained to houses valued below 2 million, with lot sizes under 250,000 square feet. Even with these contraints, the models predictive capabilities deviated with higher home prices. The deviation really becomes apparent at around $1.25 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most signifiant coefficient is zipcode with a range between -62900 and 894000, the second most significant postive coefficient is square feet of a home at 234000, and the most negative coefficient is bedrooms. The positive coefficients indicate the weight of influence the independent variables have on the mean of the dependent variable to increase; there is the opposite effect for negative coefficients on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "1. Is there an ideal location for investing? -- Taking into account price per square foot, home condition, and building materials, the two best areas to invest in are south of Seattles city center, and a small pocket north of the city. These areas provide a below average price per square foot along with average conditions and building materials ideal for renovations before renting.\n",
    "2. When is the best time to buy/sell a home? -- Purchasing a home for investment purchases should be in the winter months between November and February, whereas selling an investment property should be done between April and June for a higher return on investment.\n",
    "3. Is there a signifant difference in home price between unrenovated and renovated home? -- The data shows that renovating a home can potentially increase its value by over $150,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial steps in creating a predictive home price model provided 80% accuracy, but there is always room for improvement. Taking more data into account can help increase the models predictive capabilities. Adding more variables such as population density, crime rate, school rating, proximity to amenities, and proximity to industrial areas would definitely help in doing so. \n",
    "\n",
    "As home prices increased, the model became less accurate, so somehow refining the model based on price-points of interest could also help tighten the model for accuracy."
